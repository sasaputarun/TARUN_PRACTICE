	today i had worked on transfer data from board to board communication through spi protocal
date:30/01/26
        today i had read the QCC744m document.
date :31/01/26
	today i worked on UART protocal,i had knew about OLED module, i learned the required commands and functions for to transfer data from mcu to OLED module 
date: 02/01/26
	today i had worked on oled module,i displayed temperature and humidity on oled module usinng dht11 sensor with qcc744m.
date:03/01/26
	today i had transferred data(DHT11+AQI+RTC) over uart and displayed on minicom using qcc744m board.
date:04/02/26
	today i had worked on board to board communication over SPI 
	
	SENSORS->BOARD(master)->SPI->BOARD(master)->PC(minicom)

	i had used (DHT11,AQI,RTC) TO  transfer data(temperature,humidity,air quality and time ) from board to board over 	spi is successfully transmitted.
date:05/02/26
	today i had read datasheet and reference manual of qcc744m board for tried to learn baremetal coding 
date:06/02/26
	today i had practiced arrays sums ,and worked on baremetal coding for LED blinking
